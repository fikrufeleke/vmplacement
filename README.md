The project is a collection of virtual machine placement classes for efficient energy utilization and reduced service level agreement 
violation in cloud datacenter. The codes are to be implemented in CloudSim-3.0.3 simulator and all extend the class
PowerVmAllocationPolicyMigrationLocalRegression which available in the power package of the simulator.

If you are to use any of the virtual machine placement classes in this classes, please site the following paper:



Usage : 
Create the power datacenter and for the policy argument call one of  our virtual machine placement class.
